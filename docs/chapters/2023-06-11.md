## python to JS?

saw you can make wasm with python https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide. actually it's a python interpreter in the browser

they're introducing wasm in python. it's not ga https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/wasm/README.md

## deploy mkdocs with github actions?
yes but it failed because my packages are so old
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs

## can I just do this in the browser?
yes, and the easiest way is codespaces https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces

although they cost money it's not a lot

## upgrading pip packages

I tried to upgrade my requirements.txt with a sed expressoin and it didn't work wiht the sed on GH workspaces so I just did it manually. I got it here https://stackoverflow.com/a/60788102/5568528

although pip-upgrader looks cool https://github.com/simion/pip-upgrader but the repo recommends poetry https://python-poetry.org/

## running makedocs

https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/


```
makedocs serve
```

## can you link to 
it looks like you can by using the TOC on the rop righthand side of the pages

I'm not sure if it will take you to that part because my page isn't long enough

it looks like it though 

## how can I update my requirements.txt?

I ran a pip freeze and the output is long. I'm going to try poetry

```
# install 
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#initialising-a-pre-existing-project

```
@sblack4 âžœ /workspaces/sblack4.github.io (master) $ poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Would you like to define your main dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] yes
You can specify a package in the following forms:
  - A single name (requests): this will search for matches on PyPI
  - A name and a constraint (requests@^2.23.0)
  - A git url (git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git)
  - A git url with a revision (git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git#develop)
  - A file path (../my-package/my-package.whl)
  - A directory (../my-package/)
  - A url (https://example.com/packages/my-package-0.1.0.tar.gz)

Package to add or search for (leave blank to skip):

lol no I'm lazy

## how do I go from pip to poetry with minimal effort? 

```
cat requirements.txt | xargs poetry add
```
